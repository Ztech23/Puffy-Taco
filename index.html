      <h2>ABOUT</h2>

      <div class="columns">
        <p>
          Puffy Taco was born from long nights, loud kitchens, and a love for food that brings people together. What started as a simple idea grew from family recipes, shared tables, and learning flavor the hard way. Every tortilla, every fold, every bite reflects years of trial, tradition, and showing up hungry.
        </p>

        <p>
          Raised on street corners, backyard grills, and late-night cravings, Puffy Taco pulls from old-school comfort and bold city energy. It is food made with patience, cooked with intention, and served without shortcuts. The goal has always been simple: make something unforgettable and do it right.
        </p>

        <p>
          This is more than a menu. It is the story of building something from scratch, learning through failure, and earning every win along the way. Puffy Taco stands for hustle, heart, and flavor that hits hard and stays with you long after the last bite.
